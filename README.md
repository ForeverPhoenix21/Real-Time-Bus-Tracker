## Description:

<p> The Real-Time-Bus-Tracker is a project that uses the MTBA API and actively tracks the busses on route 1 and 7 in Massachusetts, United States. Mapbox was used for this project, and the coordinates for the bus routes were pulled from the MTBA V3 developer resources website.</p>

## Installation:

<p> Upload the HTML file to your browser or fork and clone the project saving the files to your local hard drive. </p> 
<p>You can also run the program by clicking on the above picture in this readme file.</P>

## Usage:

<p> This exercise was made to demonstrate asynchronous programing techniques along with the use of map markers. </p>

## Roadmap:

*<p> This exercise will continually be built and improved on as I learn additional skills in Javascript. </p>*
